Local Corps: A Corps for Crisis

Created during the inaugural run of the UCF Coding Bootcamp, this organization is a response to the massacre that happened in Orlando at Pulse nightclub on June 12, 2016. 

Orlando was at a loss for what to do in the face of this crisis that changed our city and the people in it forever. 
We wanted to help, but there was so much confusion, no one knew where to turn. 

Lines at blood banks were miles long. We bought t-shirts, we made donations, went to vigils, but it just never felt like enough. 
This led the to creation of this organization. 

In coordination with the city and state governments, we plan to give order and purpose to those who desire to help when our cities are in crisis, Natural or Manmade.

Local Corps members will receive information for volunteer and donation opportunities as they happen and will be able to volunteer through our site. We look forward to seeing this group grow as those who want to use whatever skills they have to band together as a united front.
